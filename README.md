Implements for Unity in fields of IoC, Reactive programming, Firebase, Photon Server, etc.

Universal Resolver is an IoC Framework, which is a combination of binding settings as scriptableobject, along with C# Attributes which allow you to resolve any fields, constructors, methods or properties as [Component], [Singleton], [Prefab] or [Transient]. 

There are a lot of test scenes in the sample folder. Also I developed a minesweeper game using this framework, inside the sampleGame folder.
This asset supports

Resolve both C# & Unity Component objects
Build games on Editor, Standalone, iOS, Android and WebGL
Write loose-couple and testable C# code.
Use binding setting files as ScriptableObject files to setup binding.
You just need to change your binding setting files, then reload your scene to have changes applied. No recompiling needed.

Here are tutorials about using this asset. You can email us for any question you have.
